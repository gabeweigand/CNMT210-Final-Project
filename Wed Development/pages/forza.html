				<p class="mainText">This game was released on October 2, 2018. I recently bought this game and I have pretty much 
				played through it. But I can’t stop coming back just to drive around and compete in their unique 
				seasonal challenges or to just drive along the gorgeous backdrop of England. This has been one of 
				the most popular car racing games and it easy to see why. Forza Horizon 4 is an incredible game to 
				play for anyone at any level. The races range from street racing to off roading. The have incredible 
				tasks to do outside of racing like stunt driving, drift zones, speed traps, and my personal favorite 
				danger signs. The most unique thing about this game compared to its predecessors is how the seasons 
				change. Every week the game changes and with the seasonal change how you drive, the road conditions, 
				and the types of events available also change. This feature keeps making me come back week after 
				week because it’s like playing an entirely different game week to week.<br><br>Listed below are some 
				of my personal reasons as to why this game is a must to play:</p>
					<!-- main text content -->
				<ul class="mainText">
					<li>Two words - Barn Finds! I smile every time a purple circle appears on my map. This means 
					that I get to hunt around for a barn that hold a unique car that you cannot buy from their store 
					of cars. These cars are not only fun to hunt down but also to race in.<br></li>
					<li>The expansion packs so far only one expansion has been released- Fortune Island- but with 
					these expansions it unlocks more races and more of the map. It prolongs the joy of the game and 
					with the seasonal changes the expansion is like never before.<br></li>
					<li>I absolutely love the wheelspins in this game. Every time you level up or gain influence you 
					work your way towards regular and super wheelspins. These spins are like a slot machine, but you 
					are guaranteed to at least win something- cash/credits, a cool new vehicle, unique character 
					clothing or a new horn can be unlocked. These wheelspins are not only fun but they can be a 
					quick way to expand your car collection or increase your credits to purchase other items<br></li>
					<li>The last thing I felt needed to be included is that this game is the first Forza game where 
					you can purchase reality. You can buy houses all around your map and some houses come with super 
					cool bonuses like unlocking skill songs and getting special vehicles. These houses range in style 
					and utility but they can be quick pit stops on drives for players to make upgrades to their cars 
					without having to go all the way back to the few Forza Horizon Hubs.</li>
