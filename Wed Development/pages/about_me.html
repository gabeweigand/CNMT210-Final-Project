				<p class="mainText">My name is Gabe Weigand and I am a video game enthusiast. I love playing new games 
				when the come out. Video games are a great way to release from daily stress and just relax. But that 
				only works if the video games are well made. Video game developers have gotten incredibly good at making 
				games look, feel and sound amazing. I have been playing video games since I was a child and seeing how 
				far they’ve come only makes me want to play more of them. A goal I have in life is to work for a video 
				game company or developer in some capacity.<br><br><br>
				I am going to be graduating college this semester and I am looking forward to having some more time to play 
				some of the new games that have recently come out that I haven’t gotten to play as much. I would recommend 
				to anyone that they should try a video game. For new comers, video games have easy settings. My wife was 
				never a video gamer because she thought she would be terrible. Now she absolutely loves playing my video 
				games on easy because they have a fun feel to them. I am excited to share my insights on my favorite video 
				games so that I can help others who may be tempted to buy the game make a purchase they are proud of.
				<br><br><br>If you have any questions about why I have ranked these games the way I have or if you want to 
				share your insights on these games as well feel free to email me at: gweig161@uwsp.edu</p>
